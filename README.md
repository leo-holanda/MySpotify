## What it does

To meet the project's requirements, I chose to use the Spotify API to collect data from a playlist on Spotify and use it to populate two tables.

The first one shows all the songs in the playlist, with the title, album and date when they were inserted. The second shows the most played songs from my account in the last 6 months from the day of the API request. In both tables it is possible to filter the songs according to their data.

Next to the first table is a slideshow that shows all album covers in the list. Next to the second table is a Spotify player with the songs in the list.

Finally, the last page shows the details of the first song in the Top Tracks list obtained through the Spotify API, such as "danceability" and "tempo".
